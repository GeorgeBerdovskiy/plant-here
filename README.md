# Rain Barrel ðŸŒ§

This simple application allows users to estimate how much water they (as individuals or as a community) may collect using rain barrels! Right now we are using Flask, but we may change technologies later.

## Prerequisites

You'll need Python version 3.6 or above (newest version preferable). You'll also need to install several libraries through the application's virtual environment (the requirements file and instructions will be added soon).
